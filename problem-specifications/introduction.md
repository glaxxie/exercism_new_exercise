# Introduction

Decobra's grandparents run a small local bookstore cafe for over 2 decades and are now retiring.
She is happy to continue the business and has thought about expanding it to have more books, while also modernizing the inventory management system to streamline operations.

Decobra wants to implement a barcode system to help with book tracking, and make the checkout process faster.
So she needs your help to implement a barcode processor that could do both encoding and decoding.
